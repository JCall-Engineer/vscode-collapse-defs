# Collapse Defs

**Selectively** collapse function and method definitions in your code using customizable regex patterns ‚Äî unlike "Fold All" which collapses everything (classes, loops, conditionals, etc.), this extension focuses on just the blocks you care about.

## üöÄ Usage

- Run the command: **Collapse All Function Blocks**
- Or use the shortcut: `Ctrl+K Ctrl+Shift+{`

This command folds all function definitions in the current file based on the active language.

---

## üéØ Why Use This?

**Standard "Fold All" (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+0`) collapses everything:**

- Classes
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if`, `switch`)
- Try-catch blocks
- Functions

**Collapse Defs only folds what you want** ‚Äî typically just functions and methods, giving you a clean overview of your code's structure without hiding control flow.

With creative regex patterns, you can collapse any subset of blocks: only public methods, only async functions, only exported functions ‚Äî whatever helps you navigate your code.

## üìã Supported Languages (Built-in Patterns)

The extension comes with default patterns for:

- **Python** - `def` and `async def` functions
- **JavaScript** - Named functions, anonymous functions, arrow functions
- **TypeScript** - Functions, methods, arrow functions (with type annotations)
- **Java** - Methods with access modifiers
- **C#** - Methods with access modifiers
- **C** - Function definitions
- **C++** - Function definitions (excludes control flow keywords)

No pattern for your language? Just add a custom regex in settings!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Custom Fold Patterns

Override or add fold patterns per language via `settings.json`:

```jsonc
"collapseDefs.foldPatterns": {
  "python": "^\\s*(async\\s+)?def\\s+\\w+\\s*\\(.*\\)\\s*(\\s*->\\s*[^:]+)?:$",
  "javascript": "^.*(async\\s+)?function(\\s+\\w+)?\\s*\\([^)]*\\)\\s*\\{$|^.*(async\\s+)?\\([^)]*\\)\\s*=>\\s*\\{$",
  "css": "^.*\\{$",
  "html": "^\\s*<[^/>]+>\\s*$"
}
```

The keys are VS Code language IDs (e.g., `"python"`, `"cpp"`, `"javascript"`), and the values are regex strings that match the opening line of a block.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see which lines are being matched:

```jsonc
"collapseDefs.debug": true
```

Output appears in the **Collapse To Defs** panel (View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí select "Collapse To Defs" from dropdown).

## üß† How It Works

The extension:

1. Scans the file from bottom to top
2. Tests each line against your regex pattern
3. Checks if the line ends with the appropriate block character (`:` for Python, `{` for C-style languages)
4. Verifies the next line is indented (multi-line block detection)
5. Folds the block if all conditions pass

**One-liners are ignored by design** ‚Äî only actual multi-line blocks get folded.

## üí° Examples

### Fold only exported TypeScript functions

```jsonc
"typescript": "^\\s*export\\s+(async\\s+)?function\\s+\\w+\\s*\\([^)]*\\).*\\{$"
```

### Fold CSS rule blocks

```jsonc
"css": "^.*\\{$"
```

### Fold HTML opening tags

```jsonc
"html": "^\\s*<[^/>]+>\\s*$"
```

Get creative with your patterns to collapse exactly what you need!
